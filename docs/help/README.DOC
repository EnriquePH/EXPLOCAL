 1. What is Help Edit
---------------------

Help Edit is a Windows Text Editor that you can use to produce Windows
Help files. Help Edit accepts simple ASCII files, allows you to create
Windows Help Topics, and finally produce an RTF (Rich Text Format) file for
input to the Microsoft Help Compiler. You can create Hypertext links, pop up
definitions, browse sequences, and include Bitmaps in your help file. Help
Edit supports the inclusion of various Fonts and Colours.

Help Edit manages all aspects of automatically generating jump labels, and
it even creates the HPJ project file required by the Help Compiler.

Once you have created your RTF files, Help Edit can call the Help compiler
from within itself, to produce an HLP help file. Finally Help Edit can test
the new Help file for you.

The Help file for Help Edit was written using itself, and so was the Tutorial.
All the Help material for a Demo help file is included so that you may study
it. In the registered version all the material for Helpedit Help and the
Tutorial Help are included.


 2. HOW TO GET HELP
-------------------

  If you have any problems, please read this file, and if you still have a
  question and need assistance, help is available from the following source:

     Write to me at the following address:

     James Herron
     29 Duncryne Place,
     Bishopbriggs
     Glasgow G64 2DP
     Scotland
     UK.

  Alternatively call me on 041 762 0967 between 6pm and 9pm Mon - Fri, or any
  time at Weekends (within reason!). Answering machine available.

  If you have a modem you can leave me a message on the ShareWare Support BBS
  in the UK on (0442) 891109 (3 lines). This BBS has a link to the Runway BBS
  in the US on 215-623-6203.

  If you are on Compuserve you can Email me at
  
                 herron@comms.eee.strathclyde.ac.uk
  
  This is on the JANET network but can be accessed via internet and
  Compuserve.

 3. INSTALLATION
----------------
  There are two options for installation:

  1. Hard Disk - This option allows you to copy all the files without
     worrying about disk space. It allows faster program operation and is
     recommended if you have a hard disk.

  2. Single Floppy - It is perfectly feasible to run Help Edit from a single
     floppy drive. In this case it is recommended that only the essential 
     files that you need are copied onto this disk.


  You should read the rest of this README file to get further
  information about this release before you do the installation.


  To perform the installation insert the floppy in drive A or B and run
  INSTALL from Windows.
  
  This completes installation, you should now put your original disk(s) in a
  save place. Start Windows and either run Help Edit from the Program Manager by
  opening the File menu and selecting Run, or better still if you installed a
  new group for Help Edit during install select it's icon for the application.


  Please refer to the section in the online help on how to set up HC.BAT to
  run with your version of the Help Compiler.

  If you have the spell checker DLL Spelmate, either install it in the same
  directory as Help Edit, or in a directory on your Path. Help Edit will look
  for Spelmate on start up, and if it is found it will be available. Note that
  Spelmate is a separate product, and it is not essential in order to run
  Help Edit.

  The current version of spelmate is V1.1, and is available on all good BBS's
  and Compuserve as SPMATE11.zip.


 4. IMPORTANT NOTES
-------------------
  o The Executable, Help and a few Document files in this package are
    compressed. If you don't use the installation program or you need to
    copy one of the original files onto your hard disk, use the UNPACK.EXE
    file located on the distribution disk. This is a Windows application.

  o As mentioned in the installation section,if you are running from a single
    drive then you should only copy the essential files required to run Help
    Edit. This means leaving off any *.doc files, and once you have run the
    examples you could remove them also.

  o At the time of writing the MicroSoft Help Compiler is available for
    download from Compuserve, and as a free download from the MicroSoft
    download service. It has been placed in the Public Domain.

  o To make help files for the widest range of users, the help complier for
    Windows 3.0 should be used as it is compatible with Windows 3.1. The
    3.1 complier will not work under Windows 3.0. Therefore a v3.0 help
    compiler is included. The Batch file HC.BAT calls this compiler, HC30.exe
    and also redirects output messages to a file Helpedit.err.

  o If you have a Windows 3.1 Help compiler you can set the Windows 3.1
    checkbox when making a help file. You may have to edit HC.BAT to tell it
    the name of your help compiler. HC.BAT has been set up to work with the
    Help compilers HC30.EXE and HC31.EXE as supplied by Borland compilers.

  o IMPORTANT refer to the online Help information about HC.BAT.

did not activate the combobox, then the Topic was never selected, and a run
time error occurs. This has been corrected.

Bug Fix. If selected more that 255 characters when changing fonts, the extra
text was lost. Corrected.

New Features - Modifications.
-----------------------------

Help Edit routes all Warning and Error messages from the Microsoft Help
compiler into a file called HelpEdit.err. It checks this file after
compilation and if any errors it invokes an editor of your choice to view
the messages. The default editor is NotePad, but you can use any other
Editor e.g. WinEdit, by selecting Choose Editor from the Options menu.

The Edit menu accelerator keys have been changed to CUA standard.

New Accelerator keys have been added to the most commom used functions such
as make Topic and make Jump.

The right mouse button is used in making Topics and Jumps to speed things up
for experienced users.

The common dialog box for files is now used.

A number of menu options have been disabled if the editor does not contain
text or have text selected. These include Save, Save As, Print, Cut, Copy,
find, and replace.
Paste only works if the clipboard has valid text.


A Windows Pif file has been added so that the Help compiler can run in a 
Window or as an icon. The default is icon.


A new HC.BAT file has been created.

IMPORTANT Refer to the online help about HC.BAT.
---------

Help Edit can call the Windows 3.0 help compiler or 3.1.


While the help compiler is running, Help Edit is disabled and becomes an
icon. This is to stop you altering files that the help compiler is using.

All messages moved to string tables.

If you change the editor text, then attempt to make a Help file without
saving the changes, Help Edit will ask if you want to save first. As
Helpedit uses the text on disk and not the editor, you should let helpedit
save the text if you want your changes to be part of the new make.

The Help Edit help file has been updated.

The Tutorial has been completely re-written.

............................................................................

26/5/93 V1.4
------------

1).
Help Edit can now make use of the Spelmate DLL. This is a DLL that adds
spell checking capabilities to any of your Windows applications. Both
American and British versions are available.

In order to keep file sizes down for users of BBS's the spelmate DLL is not
included in the version placed on BBS's, but can be obtained as a separate
file splmateX.zip where X is the current version number. At this time you
should look for splmate1.zip.

If you obtain Help Edit from a Software Library, Spelmate may be included.

Spelmate is a separate Shareware program in it's own right and requires 
registration if you wish to use it. If you order the professional version
of Help Edit, then Spelmate is included at a discount price, and you can use
it in other programs of your own.

2).
The Options menu has been changed and now contains the items
Select Editor
Check Spelling
Windows 3.1

Select Editor is the same as for Verison 1.3.
Check Spelling invokes the Spelmate Dll if it is present, AND if you have
some text in the Edit window.

Windows 3.1 is used to replace the checkbox that you had to set every time
you wanted to make a Windows 3.1 Help file from the make Help dialog box.

If you select this menu option a tick mark is inserted, and your selection is
saved in the .INI file so you need only set it once. Help Edit needs to know
this information as it affects new features that are only applicable if you
are using Windows 3.1.


3).
The insert menu can now insert a program. This is only available if you are
using Windows 3.1 as it is a macro. Select text as you would to create a 
jump link, but instead select insert program. You can then enter a program
name and command line parameters, and when the user clicks on this word or
phrase, the program will run. Note it is your responsibility to ensure that
the program exists, and that Windows will be able to find it.

4).
The insert Bitmap has been updated. Help Edit now allows the insertion of
.BMP, .SHG and .WMF files. In addition you can make these bitmaps active
Hotspots to jump links, Definitions or even run programs.

At the present time you can only preview .BMP files.

.SHG files contain their own jump links and program references. You must
create these using your own Hotspot Editor. If you use Borland compilers
this is called SHED.EXE.

You should create your topics and definitions as normal. Then after making
a Help file look at the [MAP] section of the .HPJ file to get a list of the
context strings assigned to your topics. Use these strings as the context
strings in your Hotspot Editor. Create the .SHG file, then go back and add
it at the appropriate place in the help file.

5).
The online help and Tutorial have been updated to reflect these changes.

............................................................................

01/7/93 V1.5
------------

Bug Fix. When Help Edit cannot find a Topic or Definition it did not give the
option to abort the compilation. It went ahead anyway and you were forced to
wait for an inevitable error. User now offered the chance to abort.

Bug Fix. If entered text without having opened or created a Project, and then
try to exit without saving, get a stream access error because there is no
Project name to save. User can now save at any time, with or without a Project
open, and exit. If there is no Project open, user is warned, and given the 
chance to open or create a project, and the file name added before exit. If user
does not open a project, the text file is still safely saved, and the system
will exit without an error. The user can always add the text file to a Project
at a later date. Note the file can only contain text, no Topic, Definitions or
Bitmaps can be included unless a Project exists.

Bug Fix. (More like a work around an MS problem). The MS Help Compiler will
accept a fully qualified input .HPJ file name and path, but insists on placing
the Help file it generates in the current directory, what ever it may be.
Help Edit expects the Help file to be in the Project directory when asked to
test it. If the user should change the current directory just before making
the help file, it ends up there. Help Edit now explicitly sets the current
directory to that of the Project, immediately before it calls the Help
Compiler.

New Features - Modifications.
-----------------------------

1)
The most obvious new feature is the addition of a Toolbar which mimics a
number of commonly used menu items with toolbar buttons.

2)
The next obvious change is in the improved Status bar. It has a better 3D
look and now gives additional information. As well as showing the current
line and column position, it now displays the word 'Modified' when the text
has changed. If you use the mouse or cursor keys to highlight menu items, a
short description of what each menu does appears in the status bar.
The state of the CAPS, NUM and SCROLL lock keys are also displayed.

3)
The Editor now comes up in Word Wrap mode. You can toggle the word wrap on
and off from the Edit menu. Word wrapping was originally used in V1.0 but
was dropped as the so called soft line breaks ended up in the Help file and
it looked awful. Help Edit now temporarily turns word wrap off during a save
if word wrap is enabled. Note that when word wrapping is on the editor needs
more room to hold all the additional soft line break characters. If you load
a file which is around 30K with word wrap off, you may not be able to turn
Word Wrap on. Help Edit will warn you that it has insuffient memory to perform
the operation, and you text will be unchanged.

4)
The default Windows is now assummed to be Version 3.1 and the menu item under
the Options menu is checked unless reset by the user, or you have an existing
.INI file with your settings.

5)
During spell checking by the Spelmate DLL the cursor is turned to an Hour
Glass as you may have long delays between words, (unless you are a poor
speller). Remember that spell checking will be on-going until it tells you
it has finished, or you explicitly cancel it.

6)
Help Edit now has an interface to another support program called Index-It.
Index-It is a general indexing program which is used to scan text files to
identify words that could be used as Keywords or Index words. Such word lists
are used when compiling the Index lists in books or journals, and when creating
a Hypertext system, such as a Windows Help File. Index-It will generate a word
list consisting of simple ASCII text arranged one word to a line, so that it
can be used by a number of systems, such as a DeskTop Publishing Package, to
create an Index. The file has the extension *.Idx. When you load a Project file
into Help Edit it looks to see if an Index file exists with the same name as
the Project, but with the extension .Idx. If found it is loaded.

7)
When creating or Editing Topics a number of new controls are present in the
Topic dialog box. These will only be active if an Index file was loaded.
The Keywords List box contains the index list, and words may be selected
from this list and used as keywords. See the on-line help for details.


The Help Edit help file has been updated.

The Tutorial has been re-written.


Supporting Programs.
--------------------

SPELMATE.
.........
The spell checker DLL Spelmate is now at version 1.1. It now has sample
programs in C and Visual Basic as well as Pascal. Spelmate is included in 
the professional version of Help Edit. The Shareware file is now SPMATE11.ZIP.

Index-It.
.........
Index-It Version 1.0 can be used to create keyword lists that can be used by
Help Edit, as well as other programs, eg. DTP. The Shareware file is
INDXIT11.ZIP.
